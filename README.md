# NBP-PHP-API
Small App Design. The purpose of the application is to get current exchange rates

## Launching the application
To do this, you need to run the ```composer install``` command in a terminal in the root of the application.
If you don't have the composer installed, please follow the [link](https://getcomposer.org/download/ "Composer Download")

You can then use the embedded php server by typing ```php -S localhost:8000```.
The command will start the server listening on port 8000 using the current directory where the document root is located.

## Comments
This is a running application design. In the future, I plan to expand it more, so at the moment I wasn't worried about the front end.
